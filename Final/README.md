The idea of this project is to use the Android Application created in Base to divide the
images into parts and send handwritten digit pictures to the client mobiles and use these to
classify the digits. The digits should be placed in their respective folders after the classification
of the images on the master mobile.

Deliverables:
1) Mobile Application: The mobile application will be exactly similar to Base only
you need to divide the image into 4 parts and send each piece to a different client
mobile.
2) Client Mobiles: This time you will need to train a basic deep-learning framework from
scratch on parts of the images in MNIST dataset to classify different handwritten digits.
Once you have trained the deep learning networks on the dataset you will use the
trained model to classify the images. The classified images will then need to be stored in
their respective folder on the main mobile.
